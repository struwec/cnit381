# CNIT 381 Final Project Overview
This is Team 4's GitHub Repository for the CNIT 381 Final Project. This project aims to use a Cisco WebEx chatbot to monitor and configure devices.

# Setup
## WebEx Bot
The chatbot used for this project is a Cisco WebEx bot. To use a WebEx bot to monitor and configure devices create one through WebEx. After that note down its information like the email, bot token, bot url, and its name. You will use this information to connect the skills/configurations to the bot.

## Install needed resources
---Fill in resources/libraries needed to make this run---

## Python scripts
We started putting this bot together by using the 381bot.py file found on the Canvas page for this course. With that file we replaced the connecting information with that of our own bot. For this bot to work you will need to create a webhook for it. To do this enter the command _ngrok http 5000_. After that copy the forwarding address that starts with https, this url will be used for the bot_url in the 381bot.py file.

## Bot commands
This bot allows you to run multiple commands. The commands that this bot allows you to run let you view the configuration of a device and configure a device. One of the things that this bot allows you to do is monitor when a device changes IP addresses. So that when a device changes IP addresses other devices with VPN connections to it can keep thier connection open.
